/**
 * Next.js Instrumentation — runs ONCE when the server boots, before any
 * request is served.
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. SECRET_KEY bootstrap. If the operator didn't set SECRET_KEY (very common
 *    with bare `docker run` — the docker-compose.yml sets it, but the
 *    TROUBLESHOOTING.md `docker run` examples don't), generate a random key,
 *    persist it next to the SQLite database, and inject it into the process
 *    environment so every request that follows sees a stable secret. Without
 *    this, the very first login/setup crashes with a 500 because getSecret()
 *    throws in production mode.
 *
 * 2. Auto-run database migrations so that a fresh deploy (empty SQLite volume)
 *    has its tables created before the first query lands. Fixes the "no such
 *    table" crash on fresh `docker compose` / `docker run` deploys.
 *
 * Drizzle's migrate() is journaled in __drizzle_migrations, so migration is a
 * safe no-op on databases that are already up to date.

/**
 * Self-healing migration-bookkeeping repair (guard against issue #79).
 *
 * Drizzle's migrator decides which journal entries to apply by comparing
 * each entry's `when` timestamp against ONLY the newest row in
 * __drizzle_migrations (`ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1`). If a journal
 * entry ever carries a `when` older than that row, the migrator silently
 * treats it as already-applied and skips it — the app then crashes on the
 * first query that touches the missing column.
 *
 * This happened in the wild: migrations 0005-0012 were hand-written with
 * 2025 dates while 0000-0004 were drizzle-kit-generated with real 2026
 * dates, so every upgraded install silently skipped 0010-0012 (#79).
 *
 * Repair strategy: BEFORE migrating, re-write each existing row's
 * created_at with the journal `when` of the entry whose sha256(sql-file)
 * matches the row's stored hash. Rows whose hash matches no journal entry
 * (e.g. a migration file edited after being applied) are left untouched.
 * After normalization the row sequence is strictly ascending, so:
 *   - nothing that already ran gets re-run (re-running would crash on
 *     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX), and
 *   - nothing that should run gets skipped.
